Don't waste your time surfing the web, follow my instructions and you will be able to taste the best Carbonara of your life!

## Tools
Plan your Carbonara day and procure these tools:

- Stock pot
- Spoon
- Ladle
- Pasta fork
- Pan
- Non stick pan
- Knife
- Mincing knife
- Marble or stainless still chopping board (not wood or porous material!)
- Bowl
- Cheese grater
- Dishes

The most important thing for a successful Carbonara is the **quality of the ingredients**.

## Ingredients

This recipe is for 4 persons.

- **12 oz. Gragnano spaghetti bronze drawn** (The mixture is extruded through a bronze wire drawing, which gives the desired shape and giving the pasta surface roughness and only making it more suitable to hold sauces and condiments. Better 20 in long otherwise you can use spaghetti 10~12 in long)
- **6 oz. Peppery pork cheek named guanciale** (Please, don’t use bacon named pancetta)
- **1 tsp. Salt** (be careful, you need really little salt)
- **3 oz. Roman pecorino cheese** (absolutily better Roman and better not grated)
- **1 oz. Original Parmigiano Reggiano** (if you find parmesan, be sure that is original Parmigiano and not a fake copy. Better not grated)
- **A pinch of black pepper** (optional, if the pork cheek is already peppery, you don’t need it)
- **4 Fresh orange yolk eggs** (you don’t need glair but don’t use canned yolk! You will have to separate the yolk from the egg white)

## Directions
Mix yolks, parmigiano and half pecorino in the bowl with a spoon and **add pecorino until a soft dough is obtained, not too liquid and not too tough.**

Slice the pork cheek then cut into stripes discarding the skin.
